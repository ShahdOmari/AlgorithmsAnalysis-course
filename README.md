# ALGORITHM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 

## F*actorial  Number*

W*e designed two method for calculating the factorial number*  

- I*terative*
- *Recursive*

*First of all, we have gradually entered random values to calculate the factorial from 10 to 1,000,000 by the two designs , and when we got to large values, we found that iterative calculated them while recursion did not and it took longer time than the other, here we faced the problem of stack over flow recursion because there was a stack limit that was reached, so we did not get a result. In conclusion, we have concluded that the iterative method is more efficient to calculate factorial, and so that we can avoid stack over flow and be able to reach a result in the least possible time,* *In addition to the implementation of values, it takes a different time from one device to another, due to the different nature of the devices and their speed  …*   

### This is a table and paragraph that shows the difference between the two methods in terms of execution time :
